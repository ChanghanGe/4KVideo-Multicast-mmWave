Abstract: The popularity of 4K videos is on the rise. However, streaming such high-quality videos over mm Wave to several users presents significant challenges due to directional communication, fluctuating channels, and high bandwidth demands. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an innovative 4K layered video multicast streaming system. We (i) develop a video quality model tailored for layered video coding, (ii) optimize resource allocation, scheduling, and beamforming based on the channel conditions of different users, and (iii) design a streaming strategy that integrates fountain code to eliminate redundancy in multicast groups, coupled with a Leaky-Bucket approach for congestion control. We implement our system on Commodity-Off- The-Shelf (COTS) WiGig devices and demonstrate its effectiveness through comprehensive testbed and emulation experiments. <br>
